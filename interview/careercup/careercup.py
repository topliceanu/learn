    """ A group of farmers has some elevation data, and we’re going to help
    them understand how rainfall flows over their farmland.
    We’ll represent the land as a two-dimensional array of altitudes and use
    the following model, based on the idea that water flows downhill:

    If a cell’s four neighboring cells all have higher altitudes, we call this
    cell a sink; water collects in sinks. Otherwise, water will flow to the
    neighboring cell with the lowest altitude. If a cell is not a sink, you may
    assume it has a unique lowest neighbor and that this neighbor will be lower
    than the cell.

    Cells that drain into the same sink – directly or indirectly – are said to
    be part of the same basin.

    Your challenge is to partition the map into basins. In particular, given a
    map of elevations, your code should partition the map into basins and output
    the sizes of the basins, in descending order.

    Assume the elevation maps are square. Input will begin with a line with one
    integer, S, the height (and width) of the map. The next S lines will each
    contain a row of the map, each with S integers – the elevations of the S
    cells in the row. Some farmers have small land plots such as the examples
    below, while some have larger plots. However, in no case will a farmer have
    a plot of land larger than S = 5000.

    Your code should output a space-separated list of the basin sizes, in
    descending order. (Trailing spaces are ignored.)

    While correctness and performance are the most important parts of this
    problem, a human will be reading your solution, so please make an effort
    to submit clean, readable code. In particular, do not write code as if you
    were solving a problem for a competition.

    Complexity: O(n^2) , where n - size of the input array.

        plots: list, of lists of elevations
