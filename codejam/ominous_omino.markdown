# Problem

An N-omino is a two-dimensional shape formed by joining N unit cells fully along their edges in some way. More formally, a 1-omino is a 1x1 unit square, and an N-omino is an (N-1)omino with one or more of its edges joined to an adjacent 1x1 unit square. For the purpose of this problem, we consider two N-ominoes to be the same if one can be transformed into the other via reflection and/or rotation. For example, these are the five possible 4-ominoes:

And here are some of the 108 possible 7-ominoes:

Richard and Gabriel are going to play a game with the following rules, for some predetermined values of X, R, and C:

1. Richard will choose any one of the possible X-ominoes.
2. Gabriel must use at least one copy of that X-omino, along with arbitrarily many copies of any X-ominoes (which can include the one Richard chose), to completely fill in an R-by-C grid, with no overlaps and no spillover. That is, every cell must be covered by exactly one of the X cells making up an X-omino, and no X-omino can extend outside the grid. Gabriel is allowed to rotate or reflect as many of the X-ominoes as he wants, including the one Richard chose. If Gabriel can completely fill in the grid, he wins; otherwise, Richard wins.

Given particular values X, R, and C, can Richard choose an X-omino that will ensure that he wins, or is Gabriel guaranteed to win no matter what Richard chooses?

# Input

The first line of the input gives the number of test cases, T. T lines follow. Each contains three space-separated integers: X, R, and C.

# Output

For each test case, output one line containing "Case #x: y", where x is the test case number (starting from 1) and y is either RICHARD (if there is at least one choice that ensures victory for Richard) or GABRIEL (if Gabriel will win no matter what Richard chooses).

Output

Case #1: GABRIEL
Case #2: RICHARD
Case #3: RICHARD
Case #4: GABRIEL

In case #1, Richard only has one 2-omino available to choose -- the 1x2 block formed by joining two unit cells together. No matter how Gabriel places this block in the 2x2 grid, he will leave a hole that can be exactly filled with another 1x2 block. So Gabriel wins.

In case #2, Richard has to choose the 1x2 block, but no matter where Gabriel puts it, he will be left with a single 1x1 hole that he cannot fill using only 2-ominoes. So Richard wins.

In case #3, one winning strategy for Richard is to choose the 2x2 square 4-omino. There is no way for Gabriel to fit that square into the 4x1 grid such that it is completely contained within the grid, so Richard wins.

In case #4, Richard can either pick the straight 3-omino or the L-shaped 3-omino. In either case, Gabriel can fit it into the grid and then use another copy of the same 3-omino to fill in the remaining hole.
