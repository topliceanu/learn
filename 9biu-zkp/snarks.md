# Snarks

- HH (homomorphic hiding)
E(x) is HH if:
- hard to reverse: for most xs, give E(x) it's hard to find x
- different inputs lead to different outputs: x!=y then E(x)!=E(y)
- given E(x) and E(y) you can compute E(x + y) and E(x * y) without knowing x and y.

`Zp*` - the cyclic group of pozitive integers module p over the multiplication operation.
