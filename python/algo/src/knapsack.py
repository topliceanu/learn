    """ Naively solves the knapsack problem given a capacity and a set of items.

    The knapsack problem is defined as follows: given a list of items with
    values and weights a knapsack with a given weight, optimize the knapsack usage,

    such that you maximize the value of the items in the knapsack.

    We assume item sizes and knapsack capacity are small integers in order to
    obtain polinomial running time.

    Complexity: O(n*W), n - num of items, W - num of distinct capacity values.
                This is NP-complete in the input weight. Complexity is polinomial
                only if the capacity W is not too big compared to n number of items.
