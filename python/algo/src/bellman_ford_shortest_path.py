def shortest_path(graph, s, return_paths=True):
    """ Implement the single source shortest path problem using the bellman-ford
    algorithm.

    This is usefull for graphs that may have edges with negative length.
    Also, this algorithm is highly distributed-able. It's used in BGP.

    TODO: memory optimization, notice that bellman-ford only uses the results
    from the last iteration, so everything else can be thrown out.
    TODO: implement solution reconstruction using the memory optimizations.

    Invented by Richard Bellman (1958) and Lester Ford (1856)

    Complexity: O(m*n), where m is the number of edges, n the number of nodes.

    Params:
        graph: object, instance of src.graph.Graph, structure representing a graph.
        s: int, the key of the starting vertex in the graph.
        return_paths: bool, returns the shortest paths also.

    Returns:
        tuple, format (costs, paths)
            costs: dict, format {destination_vertex: cost_to_that_vertex}
            paths: dict, format {destination_vertex: [edges_to_that_vertex]}
                Only available if returns_paths=True, otherwise is an empty dict.
