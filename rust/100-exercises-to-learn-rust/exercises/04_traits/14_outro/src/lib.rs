// TODO: Define a new `SaturatingU16` type.
//   It should hold a `u16` value.
//   It should provide conversions from `u16`, `u8`, `&u16` and `&u8`.
//   It should support addition with a right-hand side of type
//   SaturatingU16, u16, &u16, and &SaturatingU16. Addition should saturate at the
//   maximum value for `u16`.
//   It should be possible to compare it with another `SaturatingU16` or a `u16`.
//   It should be possible to print its debug representation.
//
// Tests are located in the `tests` folderâ€”pay attention to the visibility of your types and methods.
